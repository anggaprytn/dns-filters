# DNS Filters

This repository contains personal DNS filtering lists.

## Structure

- `DNS-blocklists/`  
  Contains domains to block (ads, trackers, malicious sites).

- `DNS-allowlists/`  
  Contains domains to explicitly allow (overrides blocklists if needed).

## Purpose

These lists are intended for use with DNS-based adblockers and filtering systems.

## Notes

- Lists are maintained manually.
- Prioritized for personal and experimental use.
- Format and structure may change over time.
